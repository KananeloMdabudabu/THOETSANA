      <p>We have seen the need to talk about issues affecting girls as a great number of young girls are struggling to take care of themselves and end up falling sick physically and emotionally.</p>

        <h2>Sexual health</h2>
        <p>“Tears voluntarily clouded my eyes as I saw the pregnancy test kit with two lines on it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Honestly, I was not ready; not physically matured enough to carry a whole human being in me, not financially ready to take of myself…let alone a child. Not ready to face the critics from the members of the community… actually, not ready for everything that came with pregnancy and the pregnancy itself” ~Thlolohelo upon learning that she was pregnant at the age of 16.
In this century that we live in, most of the teenage girls engage themselves in sexual activities and as a result, end up falling pregnant and getting sexually transmitted infections. In Lesotho, statistics point out that every week, almost 28 girls fall pregnant and in that 28, almost 18 of them are infected with HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. 
On the other hand, girls get sick from poor hygiene. The usage of cloths rather than sanitary towels and tampons when girls are on their periods is a major issue. Also the usage of pit latrines, public toilets and unhygienic toilets cause infections. 
To avoid all of these and many others, girls are advised to abstain from sexual activities, use contraceptives if they can’t abstain and use sterilizers and disinfectants for toilets. If they can’t afford them, they can opt to squad.
It is very much advisable that girls take care of themselves to keep their sexual health on point!

        <h2>Nutrition and fitness</h2>
        <p>  Nutrition is the most important part of fitness and that is because the food we eat plays a vital role in how we look and feel .As women, many of us are prone to neglecting our own dietary needs. You may feel you are too busy to eat that may leave you short on vital nutrients and feeling hungry and low on energy.

 Looking after your emotional health and wellness is just as caring for your physical health. Optimizing your wellness can help you to take control of your emotions and behavior because Life is not always pleasant or easy but feeling constantly unhappy or so unhappy you cannot function is a problem you can overcome.
While women tend to need fewer calories than men, our requirements for certain vitamins and minerals are much higher. Hormonal changes associated with menstruation, child-bearing, and menopause mean that women have a higher risk of anemia, weakened bones, and osteoporosis, requiring a higher intake of nutrients such as iron, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D.e.t.c.

        <h2>Emotional health</h2>
        <p>As a teenager, balancing your social life and school can be quite stressful and most of us tend to isolate ourselves as a coping mechanism resulting in feelings of loneliness which only act as a doorway in opening routes for a thousand mental illnesses. As a girl, around this age is where the decisions you make will affect your future the most therefore you ought to choose and act right.
The people you surround yourself with contribute to the kind of energy you will attract alas; keeping your circle small and clean would really go along way for you. Being emotionally at ease is an important trait for it encourages a healthy mind of which with we are able to achieve more, for example when the brain is well rested it works better making it easier to focus and get higher grades in class.
People tend to ignore how important emotional health is in a girl’s daily life. Practicing good social skills and making sure that you have a good solid support system will solely help solve most of the challenges you face.
